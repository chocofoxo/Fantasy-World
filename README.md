# Fantasy World
Final project for Managing Data in C++ (ITP365) at USC. 

This project uses the Stanford C++ Library, which can be downloaded here: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/StanfordCPPLib/

### Goal: 
Create a world of various creatures with unique rules tied to movement, reproduction, and interaction with other creatures. Determine which starting configuration of creatures leads to the most sustainable world, defined by the longest-lasting creature diversity.

### Setup:
This program has only been tested in Xcode on macOS Catalina. Compatibility with other platforms is not guaranteed. 

Download and build the product in Xcode. Input the world to test (world1, world2 world3, world4, world5, or world6) and press Start. You may Pause, Start, or Quit the simulation at any time.

### Input: 
Text files (world1 - world6) listing the starting values for each type of creature.

### Output: 
A simulation of the designed world, changing every second based on rules established for each creature and creature interactions.

### Additional information:
Details of creature rules and write-up of results can be found in the file WRITE-UP.
